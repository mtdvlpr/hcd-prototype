# hcd-prototype

This is a prototype for the HCD project.

## 3-4-2024

In the interview I came to the conclusion that the most important features would be to detect colors of a piece of clothing and to detect matching pieces of clothing. Another point to consider is that the user wants to be able to do things herself.

I created a prototype that can detect colors of a piece of clothing and that can detect matching pieces of clothing. The user can take a picture of a piece of clothing and the app will detect the colors of the piece of clothing. The user can then select a color by file input, color picker or text and the app will show matching pieces of clothing.

Today I had a feedback session with Vasilis. He was excited about the prototype I had already made.

During the user test I found out that the user was able to use the app and get the desired results. The file input was a bit difficult to use, because of the default text "Choose a file". The user expected a description of "Take an image". The user also wanted to take a picture of herself instead of the environment, which I set as the default. The form did not reset after submitting, which was confusing for the user, because the new value was not used.

I updated the prototype with the feedback from the user test. The default text of the file input is now "Take an image". The user can now take a picture of herself, the environment or use an existing image. The form now resets after submitting. I showed the updated prototype to Eric. He was happy with the changes I made, but he urged me to think about adding nonsense. I will think about this in the next sprint.
