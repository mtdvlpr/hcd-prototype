This is a prototype for the HCD project.

In the interview I came to the conclusion that the most important features would be to detect colors of a piece of clothing and to detect matching pieces of clothing. Another point to consider is that the user wants to be able to do things herself.

I created a prototype that can detect colors of a piece of clothing and that can detect matching pieces of clothing. The user can take a picture of a piece of clothing and the app will detect the colors of the piece of clothing. The user can then select a color by file input, color picker or text and the app will show matching pieces of clothing.

During the user test I found out that the user was able to use the app and get the desired results. The file input was a bit difficult to use, because of the default text "Choose a file". The user expected a description of "Take an image". The user also wanted to take a picture of herself instead of the environment, which I set as the default. The form did not reset after submitting, which was confusing for the user, because the new value was not used.
